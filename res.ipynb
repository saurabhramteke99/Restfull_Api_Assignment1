    "Que3. What is Flask, and why is it popular for building APIs ?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: Flask is a micro-framework, meaning it provides the essential tools to get started with web development—such as routing, request handling, and a built-in development server—without imposing additional components like database abstraction layers or form validation. This minimalistic approach allows developers to choose the libraries and tools that best fit their project's needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Flask's popularity for API development stems from several key features:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Lightweight and Flexible: Flask's minimalistic design allows developers to build APIs without unnecessary overhead, offering complete control over the application's components and structure. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Extensible with Extensions: Flask supports numerous extensions that add functionality such as authentication, database integration, and form handling, enabling developers to customize their APIs as needed. \n",
    "\n",
    "3) Rapid Prototyping: Its simplicity and ease of use make Flask ideal for quickly developing prototypes or Minimum Viable Products (MVPs), allowing for fast iteration and testing. \n",
    "\n",
    "4) RESTful Request Dispatching: Flask's routing system supports RESTful request dispatching, making it straightforward to build APIs that adhere to REST principles.\n",
    "\n",
    "5) Built-in Development Server and Debugger: Flask includes a built-in development server and debugger, facilitating local testing and debugging during API development. \n",
    "\n",
    "6) Unit Testing Support: Flask provides integrated support for unit testing, allowing developers to ensure the reliability and correctness of their APIs. "

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Client-Side Storage with Server-Side Security: Flask's session mechanism uses cookies to store a session identifier on the client's browser. The actual session data is stored on the server and is associated with this identifier. To prevent tampering, Flask signs the session data cryptographically using a secret key. This ensures that while clients can view the session contents, they cannot modify them unless they know the secret key.\n",

    " * Key Features of Flask's session Object\n",
    " \n",
    "1. Dictionary-Like Behavior: The session object behaves like a standard Python dictionary, allowing you to set and retrieve values using key-value pairs.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Automatic Handling of Modifications: Flask automatically tracks modifications to the session. If you change a mutable object stored in the session, you need to manually set session.modified = True to ensure that the changes are saved.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Session Expiration: By default, sessions are temporary and expire when the user closes their browser. However, you can make a session permanent by setting session.permanent = True, which allows you to specify a custom session lifetime using PERMANENT_SESSION_LIFETIME.\n",
